✅ Final notes & testing checklist

Local test (recommended first)

mvn clean package

java -Dstorage.mode=local -jar target/allure-platform-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

Visit http://localhost:8080/ and upload an allure-results.zip (it must contain allure-results/ folder).

Click Load Runs → View → Download.

S3 test

Set env vars: AWS_REGION, AWS_S3_BUCKET, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

Run java -Dstorage.mode=s3 -jar target/allure-platform-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

Upload; check S3 bucket reports/<app>/<release>/<runId>/index.html and other files.

Allure CLI

Locally you must have allure in PATH for the report generation steps to work (or use Docker to include Allure, or use the Dockerfile which bundles Allure).

Permissions

For S3, prefer IAM role (ECS task role / EC2 instance profile). If using keys, store in pipeline or env vars.

Azure pipeline / ECR

If you want, I’ll provide an azure-pipelines.yml next that builds, pushes to ECR and updates ECS.
